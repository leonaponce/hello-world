# hello-world
This is just a test. I'm now a developer. I'm so stoked!
Leona here. I love writing, creating, and singing. I'm determined to thrive by living passions through tech, mental health and entrepreneurship.
I've had some crazy shit happen to me but I am relentless and wholeheartedly pursuing a life of victory.
